# DIABETES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Building a machine learning web app that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning. This project is done in Python. The web app was made using Streamlit. We use the supervised learning algorithm in this case to cluster the data into diabetic and non-diabetic patients. We load the data in the machine learning model, then the model learns from the data and its columns. We train our model with different medical information like blood pressure, BMI, etc. Once the model inputs the data, it plots the data in a graph to make a hyper plane, which clusters the data in 2 parts-diabetic and non-diabetic. So now when we input a new data it will automatically put it into one of the clusters, either diabetic or non-diabetic. At first we analyze and clean the data to standardize it so that it has a common range, then train and build our model. We then test our model and then make the front end web app using Streamlit.
